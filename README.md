Hi, I am Avazbek Husainov. I am a Computer Science major at Wright State University. Over the summer, I would like to work on creating a personal portfolio. I will most likely need to use and brush up on HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript. I would also like to develop a more refined chess game probably using Java and Java Swing libraries.
